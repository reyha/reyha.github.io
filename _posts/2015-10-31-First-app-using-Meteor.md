I have recently started working on this amazing JavaScript App platform, [**__METEOR__**] ({% https://www.meteor.com %}). It is an ultra-simple platform that can be used to build modern day web applications.Apps in Meteor are written in pure Javascript and are sent on the wire rather than HTML using user's own choice of open source libraries. In addition to that, it makes deploying this app very easy with its new, cool features. Documentation and tutorials are very easy to follow.
My first app which is a to-do list app. Click [**here**] ({%http://reyha-app1.meteor.com/ %}) to view.
More information about it can be found on [https://www.meteor.com] ({% https://www.meteor.com %}).
