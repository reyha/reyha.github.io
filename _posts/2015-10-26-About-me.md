I am a **third** year student pursuing my **B.Tech** from National Institute of Technology, Srinagar doing my majors in *Computer Science Engineering*.I love to do stuff in python, C and C++. Besides this, I find HTML, CSS and JavaScript really fascinating. In my past time I like to play Table-Tennis and Badminton and groove to some of my favourite songs.
