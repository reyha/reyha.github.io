<b>CUDA</b> ( <b>C</b>ompute <b>U</b>nified <b>D</b>evice <b>A</b>rchitecture ) is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by <b>NVIDIA</b>.
It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU).
If you want to write your own code, the easiest way to harness the performance of GPUs is with the CUDA Toolkit, which provides a comprehensive development environment for C and C++ developers.
The CUDA Toolkit includes a compiler, math libraries and tools for debugging and optimizing the performance of your applications. You'll also find code samples, programming guides, user manuals, API references and other documentation to help you get started.
